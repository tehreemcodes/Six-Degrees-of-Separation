# Six-Degrees-of-Separation
This project is a Python-based AI application that finds the **shortest connection path** between two actors based on the movies they've appeared in. It's inspired by the game **"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"**, where the goal is to show how any actor is linked to Kevin Bacon through no more than six film collaborations.

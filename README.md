# üé¨ Six Degrees of Separation - Actor Connection Finder

This project is a Python-based AI application that finds the **shortest connection path** between two actors based on the movies they've appeared in. It's inspired by the game **"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"**, where the goal is to show how any actor is linked to Kevin Bacon through no more than six film collaborations.

## üìå Project Overview

Using structured data from IMDb-style CSV files, the program builds a graph of actors and movies. It then employs **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to determine the shortest sequence of shared movie appearances between any two actors.

---

## üß† Key Features

- Loads and parses actor and movie data from CSV files.
- Resolves ambiguities when multiple actors share the same name.
- Finds the shortest connection path between any two actors.
- Prints a human-readable chain of movies connecting them.
- Includes two BFS implementations (standard and alternative).
- Handles edge cases like:
  - Same actor selected as source and target.
  - No path found between the actors.

## üìÅ Dataset

The `small/` directory contains three essential CSV files:

| File         | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `people.csv` | Actor details: ID, Name, Birth Year  |
| `movies.csv` | Movie details: ID, Title, Year       |
| `stars.csv`  | Relationships: Actor ID ‚Üî Movie ID   |

Example:
people.csv: 102,Kevin Bacon,1958
movies.csv: 104257,A Few Good Men,1992
stars.csv: 102,104257

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tehreemcodes/Six-Degrees-of-Separation.git
cd Six-Degrees-of-Separation

### 2. Add Dataset Files
Place your people.csv, movies.csv, and stars.csv files inside the root directory or in a folder named small/ as needed.

If your dataset is large, adapt the file paths in the script accordingly.
